# News Feed Coding Challenge

I went further by setting up server mocking, better fetching and error handling. All in all it was a fun exercise and I'm happy with the result.

I've used React with Vite, TailwindCSS, SWR for the fetching and MSW for mocking.

Now added mobile styles for the grid!

I hope it's easy to read!

Cheers,

Matt
