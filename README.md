# Coding Challenge

Thanks for the invitation to do this coding challenge.

I probably went a little overboard by setting up server mocking and error handling and things like that. But all in all it was a fun exercise and I'm happy with the result.

I've used React with Vite, TailwindCSS, SWR for the fetching and MSW for mocking.

I hope it's easy to read!

Cheers,

Matt
